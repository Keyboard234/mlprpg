Work in progress My Little Pony 2d top-down RPG game.
Sorry for the lack of documentation and messy code.

Created on Linux with Python 3.10.12, requires pygame.

Both pony sprite sheets were created by ZEkA10000 on deviantart. They replied to a comment, saying "Yes, you can use it for free if you'll credit me," so I assumed it was OK to use it here.

All the code is free to use (except the pony sprites because those arent mine)
The tile images are mine, and you can use them without credit (but they are bad)
If you use anything I made, please make that free and open source as well.

My Little Pony is owned by Hasbro.
